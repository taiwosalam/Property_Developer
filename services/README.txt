# Services Folder

This folder is used to manage interactions with external APIs and handle business logic that isn't directly tied to UI components. It typically contains functions and classes that perform tasks like fetching data, handling authentication, or interacting with third-party services.

## Example Folder Structure:
services/
├── api.js            # API service layer for making HTTP requests
├── auth.js           # Authentication logic and service functions
└── analytics.js      # Functions for handling analytics tracking
